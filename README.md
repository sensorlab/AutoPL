# AutoPathloss: Pathloss Approximation with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

## Overview

This repository contains a suite of Jupyter notebooks implementing automatic pathloss approximation using Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) networks. KA networks are a class of neural networks particularly suited for function approximation. We explore their performance on both measured and synthetic pathloss data.

We study the feasibility of approximation using data generated with the existing ABG and CI models as well as with empirical measurements.
